# LabVIEW_NXG

A collection of my projects created specifically for LabVIEW NXG.  These won't work with LabVIEW CG

## Projects
* Hardware Abstraction Layer: a framework that assists in running SCPI commands against instruments
* Unit Test Framework: a framework for writing and running unit tests against LabVIEW NXG VIs

## Notes
Check dependencies for a project.  E.g. Hardware Abstraction Layer has a number of unit tests that you could download but these require the Unit Test Framework to also be downloaded.
